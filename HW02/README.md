   4. Open the downloaded file with IPython, and execute the commands and write your own code in blank cells.

   5. Commit and push the file.

   6. Edit the file "README.md" in your repository (create a file if not existing)
      to make a link to your notebook through [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/):

      Add to README.md the following line:

      ```
      [My notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/USER/REPO/blob/master/FILENAME.ipynb)
      ```

      where you change
      * USER to your user name,
      * REPO to your repository name, and
      * FILENAME to your file name.

      [Here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/oyamad/theory14/blob/master/markov/JarvisShier_ex.ipynb)
      is an example of the outcome.
