Homework 1
==========

* Create your own user account at [GitHub](https://github.com).

* Press the "Star" button on the [course repository page](https://github.com/oyamad/theory14)
  (or on this page),
  so that I can recognize your username.

* As an exercise, try to create a new repository at GitHub.

* To manage your repositories, you are advised to install a GUI client
  (or you may use the command line version).
  I would recommend [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com).
  (Ask Google how to use it.)

* You may refer to [Exercise 2](http://quant-econ.net/py/getting_started.html#exercise-2)
  in [Setting up Your Python Environment](http://quant-econ.net/py/getting_started.html).
