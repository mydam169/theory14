Stewart, Probability, Markov Chains, Queues, and Simulation, 2009, Section 10.2
(or [these slides](http://www.sti.uniurb.it/events/sfm07pe/slides/Stewart_1.pdf), pages 46-81),
and/or

1.
Implement the (scaled) Gaussian elimination and the GTH algorithm.

2.
Apply your routines to the following matrix `A`:

```python
[[-(q+e), q     , e   ],
 [q     , -(q+e), e   ],
 [e     , e     , -2*e]]
```

where `q` is between 0 and 1 (say 0.5),
and `e` is very small.  
Compare the outcomes for `1e-8`, ..., `1e-16` as values of `e`.

3.
Apply your routines to stochastic matrices arising from the KMR model.

Due on December 2:  
Push your python script file and/or IPython notebook to your GitHub repository.
