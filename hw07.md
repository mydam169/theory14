Homework 7
==========

Following our discussion on finite states/actions Markov decision processes:

1. Implement the policy iteration and the modified policy iteration algorithms.

   (For details on error bounds and stopping criteria, see Sections 6.3.2, 6.5.1, and 6.6.2 in
   [Chapter 6](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470316887.ch6/pdf) of Puterman (2005).)

2. Compare the three algorithms using the consumption/saving model from the previous homework.  
   (For timing the code, refer to [this lecture](http://quant-econ.net/py/ipython.html#timing-code).)

3. Compare the three algorithms using the disretized version (in Section 4.2.2) of the model
   described in Example 3 of Section 2.3 in
