Homework 7
==========

Following our discussion on finite states/actions Markov decision processes:

1. Implement the value iteration and the modified value iteration algorithms.

2. Compare the three algorithms using the consumption/saving model from the previous homework.  
   (For timing the code, refer to [this lecture](http://quant-econ.net/py/ipython.html#timing-code).)

3. Compare the three algorithms using the disretized version (in Section 4.2.2) of the model
   described in Example 3 of Section 2.3 in
