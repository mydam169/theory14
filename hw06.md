Homework 6
==========

Following our discussion on finite states/actions Markov decision processes:

1. Implement the Bellman operator.

2. Implement the value iteration algorithm.

3. Code a class, say `MDP`, that implements the above as its methods.  
   (Refer to [this lecture](http://quant-econ.net/py/python_oop.html#defining-your-own-classes).)

4. Using your code, analyze the consumption/saving model in Section 5.2
   (with parameter values as specified in Listing 5.1):
   for example, simulate the controlled Markov chain.

Due on December 9:
